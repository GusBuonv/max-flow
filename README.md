# Max Flow

A Python implementation of Dinic's algorithm for maximum flow utilizing a
splay-tree data structure.

User be warned: This implementation is functional but in now way optimized. This
is public only as a showcase and to potentially serve as a starting point for an
optimized implementation. If you are looking for a production-ready max flow
solver, you are better off using a standard implementation of the push-relabel
algorithm.
